- 👋 Hi, I’m @mikejosesr
- 👀 I’m interested in open source IIoT platforms, including all things backend, transport, brokering, edge, and analytics.  That's not too much is it?
- 🌱 I’ve figured out the more I know, how little I actually do know...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone else interested in this topic.
- 📫 How to reach me: mikejose.sr@gmail.com
